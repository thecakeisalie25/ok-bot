# ok-bot
Just a bot. May become public at one point. but you're free to use the source as you please.

## Want a copy?
1. Clone the repository into a folder using `git clone https://github.com/thecakeisalie25/ok-bot.git` and enter the folder.
2. Install npm and node.js (differs depending on distro/windows, google it.) and discord.js (`npm install discord.js`).
3. Create your own copy of config.json from example-config.json, and edit index.js with the correct pollschannel ID.
4. To run the bot, type `node .`

## Notes
There will likely be bugs, as this was hastily thrown together and my first project!  
This will update frequently, as I add more crap / fix bugs that people just keep discovering.  
I hope you enjoy this project, because I certainly did creating it.
